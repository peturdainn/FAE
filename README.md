# FAE - Find And Execute - recursively find files and execute a command on them

## What?
Find And Execute (FAE) is a small Windows commandline tool I wrote back in 2007 to recursively execute a tool on many files. It deals with spaces and weird characters in names and paths where other tools or methods fail. Which is why I wrote it in the first place ;)
